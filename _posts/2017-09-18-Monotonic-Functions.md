Functions that either increase or decrease over their lifetime
ex. logx ,
[Please , follow the link to understand monotonic functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-SrUHIVOAA)

As mentioned,

#### Theorem
1. A function has an inverse iff it is one-to-one
2. If $$f$$ is strictly monotonic on its domain, then it is one-to-one and therefore, has an inverse.

Definition:

Strictly monotonic functions are always increasing or always decreasing
$f'(x) > 0  |  f'(x) <0 $ for all $$x$$

If a function is monotonic, then the functions id one-to-one and therefore has an inverse
Let's take the following examples

1. $f(x) = {x^2}+8x+1\\$
2. $f(x) = 2x+\sin x\\$
3. $f(x) = {\frac {x}{x+1}}\\$
